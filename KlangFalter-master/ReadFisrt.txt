This code creates a simple audio plugin called KlangFalter. The plugin is a convolution
plugin, which means that it takes an audio signal and convolves it with an impulse response.
The impulse response is a pre-recorded audio signal that is used to shape the sound of the
plugin.

The code defines a class called KlangFalter that inherits from the AudioPluginInstance class.
The AudioPluginInstance class is the base class for all audio plugins in JUCE. It provides
a number of methods that are used to interact with the audio engine.

The KlangFalter class overrides the prepareToPlay(), processBlock(), and getName() methods.
The prepareToPlay() method is called once before the plugin starts processing audio. It is
used to initialize the plugin's state. The processBlock() method is called repeatedly to
process audio. The getName() method returns the name of the plugin.

The KlangFalter class also defines a static method called createPluginFilter(). This method
creates an instance of the KlangFalter class and returns it. This method is used by the
Juce framework to create the plugin instance.

The START_PLUGIN_FACTORY() macro is used to register the KlangFalter plugin with the
Juce framework. This macro tells the framework that the KlangFalter plugin can be created
by calling the createPluginFilter() method.

To compile and run the code, you will need to have JUCE installed. You can download JUCE
from the JUCE website.

Once you have JUCE installed, you can compile the code by opening the KlangFalter.jucer
project file in Projucer. Projucer is a free cross-platform GUI editor for JUCE projects.

Once the code has been compiled, you can run the plugin by opening it in a DAW.
